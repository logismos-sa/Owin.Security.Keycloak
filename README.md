# Owin.Security.Keycloak

This is the unofficial keycloack adapter for asp.net applications. It is designed as an OWIN authentication middleware component, and can import user data, including roles and authorization information, into the OWIN pipeline for use in ASP.NET, WPF, and any other C# application.

## Status
This is a fork from the latest active fork owned by @mattmorg55. After some years using this adapter, we have made some fixes and improvements to the adapter, some of those were already made from that fork or other forks, and some are custom.
